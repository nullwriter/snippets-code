Snippets of different projects

# /angular

It contains 2 files: a data provider service where I consume to obtain my data, and a file showing how to consume this service. This model provides an easy way to centralize the way you obtain data without manuall using $http.

# /laravel

Contains 2 folders where I included different files of 2 projects I worked on recently. Project1 (most recent) contains Controller and Repository model, as well as some Database Migrations.
Project2 folder contains 2 laravel packages I wrote for a project I worked on in October 2016. 

# /python

Contains a snippet file from a desktop python application I created for a freelancer.com job (worth 466$). This app would automize a voting system and solve Google Captcha. I included the file where this captcha is solved.
It could ask 3 different API providers, where you would send the image and they would respond with the answer in the form of a string. e.g. "2,4,6".
